# EAB.finance
EAB is the governance token of EAB Finance. EAB Finance is a decentralized lending aggregator, which converges various liquidity platforms, and operates on TRON block chain. This platform standardises the decentralized interest, helping users place their assets in the highest-interest lending agreements. To make sure your assets stay in the highest yield agreement, when the interest rates of these agreement fluctuate, it will automatically transfer the assets to higher yield agreements through intelligent contract interaction. 2% of Vault profit is sent to the developer fund, of which 1% is harvest bonus, 1% is the insurance reserve and .

EAB is an experimental protocol that combines programmable money and some exciting innovations in governance. The main features are as following:

The aggregation mode
Decentralized publishing
Governance to ensure stability
Completely achieved the chain management: decentralizing from the beginning
Establish a fair distribution mechanism to encourage the members of the community to take the responsibility consciously
EAB is one of the least feasible monetary experiments. EAB tokens will be worth zero when they are initially launched. After development, the value of the token will depend entirely on EAB holders and future trends. EAB uses a branch of the composite governance module, which will ensure that all updates to the EAB protocol occur entirely along the chain through community voting. Immediately after the launch, ownership of each EAB agreement will be transferred to EAB holders.

We will soon publish the smart contract audit report from a well-known institution globally。

Future planning
EAB will be controlled entirely by the owners of EAB in the future. Although, the intrinsic value of EAB is zero, the way emerging assets are controlled through community governance may generate investment value. The EAB ownership community will determine and update the features of the EAB agreement, including the use of predictive computers, repurchase functions, inflation, incentive mechanism design, EAB gold bank, etc. Any future allocation of capital would ultimately be controlled by EAB token holders, as would any yield it might generate. In theory, such a reserve vault could add robustness and security to the agreement if EAB holders are properly nurtured.

How will EAB be released
EAB will be distributed entirely in the spirit of community autonomy, with no tokens allocated to the founding team, no upfront payments, no founder shares, and no VC benefits.

USDT-TRX 15000
EAB 50000
CLAM-TRX 50000
EAB-TRX 200000
After the initial distribution pool is launched, EAB will stimulate the second wave distribution through the EAB/TRX Justswap pool. This pool will allow Justswap provide the liquidity and necessary inputs for the repurchase based on the TWAP price predictor.
